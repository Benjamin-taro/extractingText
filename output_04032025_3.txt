Abstract-The advantages, disadvantages, and issues involved in the panel analysis of travel
behavior are discussed. Increased statistical efficiency, possibility of improved prediction, and the
ability to observe changes and examine behavioral dynamics, are among the advantages panel data
offer. Their disadvantages, on the other hand, stem from the added biases and costs of panel
survey, and increased complexity involved in the analysis. Following a discussion of response lags,
leads, and other dynamic elements of travel behavior, the paper offers a brief review of statistical
methods available for the analysis of panel data. Use of panel data and dynamic models for
demand forecasting is then described, followed by sample size, interview frequency, and other
considerations in panel survey design and administration.
1, INTRODUCTION
Panel analysis of travel behavior has received increasing attention in recent years.t Dy-
namic analysis, which is often based on panel data, was the major subject of the 1988
travel behavior conference at Oxford. Several sessions were held also on this subject in the
1989 World Conference on Transport Research in Yokohama, and the Third International
Conference on Survey Methods in 1990 hosted a workshop on longitudinal surveys. The
same enthusiasm is held by the practitioners as evidenced by the number of panel studies
being planned or initiated within the past few years.
This paper offers a review of the advantages, disadvantages, and issues involved in the
panel analysis of travel behavior. The intent of the paper is not to cover the subject in
technical detail, but to offer a brief overview with emphasis on the practical significance of
panel analysis in transportation planning. It is hoped that the paper contributes to a
widespread recognition of the usefulness of, and potential difficulties in panel survey and
analysis of travel behavior.
The next section contains discussions of the factors that motivate panel analysis.
Section 3 is concerned with dynamic aspects of travel behavior, in particular response lags.
Classes of analytical methods used in dynamic travel demand analysis are reviewed in
Section 4, and Section 5 is concerned with the application of dynamic models to demand
forecasting. Issues in panel survey design and administration are discussed in Section 6.
2. WHY PANEL ANALYSIS?
Perhaps the most frequent reason that motivates a panel study is the evaluation of the
impact of a change in the transportation system, or a specific transportation planning
project, especially when the project involves novel elements. Examples include a panel
study of downtown employees in Honolulu conducted in connection with a staggered work
hours demonstration project (Giuliano and Golob, 1989; Golob and Giuliano, 1989), 
study of freeway commuters to evaluate the impact of new high-occupancy vehicle (HOV)
lanes in San Diego (Supernak and Kitamura, I989), and a study of state employees 
Sacramento and San Francisco to measure the impact of telecommuting on household
travel patterns (Pendyala et al., 1989; Kitamura, Goulias, and Pendyala, 1990). Public
transit fare changes underlie the London panel (Terzis, 1988) and the Dutch National
Mobility Panel (Golob et al. 1986; van Wissen and Meurs, 1989) which are both consid-

ly of the same sample.

ered to be general-purpose panels for transportation planning. Monitoring the change in
mobility is also among the purposes of such general-purpose panels.
The advantages of a panel are clear in these cases. Panel members are sampled to
include individuals (or households) that are influenced by the change in the system (possi-
bly along with individuals that are not influenced as control group members). Repeated
observation of the same respondents implies that unobserved contributing factors are well
controlled, facilitating more precise measurement of behavioral changes. It also reduces
sampling errors, leading to reduced sample size requirements compared with repeated
cross-sectional surveys (additional discussions can be found in Section 6).
Another often cited advantage of panel analysis is its ability to identify temporal
variation in travel behavior. This is analogous to the case of the analysis of multi-day travel
behavior (e.g. Hanson and Huff, 1988; Kitamura, 1988a; Pas, 1988; Pas and Koppelman,
1986). Observing travel patterns of individuals and households over several consecutive
days, has offered insights into activity scheduling and travel planning. Variability in travel
patterns has important policy implications as well. This is well exemplified in the following
hypothetical case which draws on Ben-Porath (1973):
¯ . . consider the common finding from a one-day survey that, say, 10 percent of a
sample group rode the bus on the survey day. One interpretation is that 10 percent of the
population always rides the bus .... at the other extreme is the interpretation that
everyone in the population rides the bus 10 percent of the time (Hanson and Huff,
1988).
Policy and planning implications of this example is obvious.
In case of panel data, changes in travel behavior is observed with much longer
intervals; emphasis here is not on stochastic variations in travel patterns or scheduling
behavior, but on long-term changes such as turnovers in mode use. Based on the London
panel data, Stokes (1988) notes the "loyalty" shown by frequent public transit users. The
ability to identify who tends to be a loyal transit user, a willful solo driver, or an experi-
menter of new modes, would be crucial for successful transit marketing or carpool promo-
tion. Panel data facilitate such identification.
Panel data also offer a setting for direct observation of changes in contributing
factors and changes in behavior. This reduces the possibility of being confounded by the
typically strong correlation among possible contributing variables, and facilitates the
identification of cause-effect relationship (Golob, 1990; Kitamura, 1989b).
Forecasting is another area where the practical value of panel analysis can be, and
should be, realized. The fundamental assumption inherent in a model estimated on a
cross-sectional data set (a cross-sectional model) is that a behavioral measure at time 
Y(t), can be expressed as a function of explanatory variables, X(t), and an error term, e(t),
also at time t when the data were taken. Thus, systematic variations in Y are related to
variations in X within the same cross section. Applying this relation to forecasting would
involve longitudinal extrapolation of cross-sectional variations; changes in behavior over
time would be predicted based on differences in behavior across individuals.
Despite the fact that most forecasting models in use are cross sectional and embody
this assumption, its validity has not been tested in any rigorous manner. In fact recent
findings on cross-sectional and dynamic measures of correlation (Goodwin, 1987; Kita-
mura and van der Hoorn, 1987) cast doubt on this long-held assumption. There are several
conditions that must be satisfied for this assumption to hold (Kitamura, 1986):
1. behavioral changes in instantaneous,
2. behavioral changes are symmetric, or reversible, and
3. behavioral relation is stationary (invariant over time).
If these conditions all hold, then behavior is contemporaneous. Our casual observation as
well as recent evidence in the literature, however, are against this notion of contemporane-
ous behavior. To the contrary, capturing the dynamics in travel behavior may be of funda-Panel analysis in transportation planning 4O3
mental importance for the analysis and prediction of travel demand. This leads to the
discussion of Section 3 on dynamic characteristics of travel behavior.
Not only being based on a more plausible behavioral foundation, dynamic models
also offer the possibility for improved predictive accuracy in forecasting. This is in part
due to the fact that longitudinal data contain more information for each behavioral unit
than do cross-sectional data. Forecasting with dynamic models is yet a novel concept in
transportation planning. Further analysis is needed to determine how much improvement
can be expected from the use of longitudinal data and dynamic models. The effort by
Wolfe (1989) presents an initial attempt toward this goal.
Finally, panel analysis is the most effective, sometimes the only means through which
dynamic aspects of travel behavior can be investigated. Understanding travel behavior
dynamics is important in evaluating planning projects and monitoring changes in mobility
as well as in formulating predictive models and making forecasts. For example, individu-
als’ adaptation to a change in the supply system is dynamic involving time lags caused by
various reasons. Observed behavior and attitudes change not spontaneously but gradually
after a system change, sometimes involving over reaction. Giuliano and Golob (1989), for
example, note dramatic shifts in attitudes toward staggered work hours before, during, and
after a demonstration project in Honolulu. An evaluation of a new system or system
improvement may be imprecise or even erroneous if it is not based on an understanding of
time lags involved in individuals’ responses.
3. TRAVEL BEHAVIOR DYNAMICS
Factors contributing to the travel behavior of a household or an individual change
almost continuously. At the macroscopic level, continuing urbanization, evolving consum-
er technology and products, telecommunications systems, highway and transit improve-
ments, and energy and air quality policies all contribute to urban residents’ travel decision.
At the microscopic level changes in household attributes such as income, household
composition, employment, and license holdings would lead to residential relocation, car
acquisition or disposal, and changes in daily travel patterns. The discussion of this section
is concerned with the magnitude and timing of the response to changes in such contribut-
ing factors.t The discussion is at a conceptual and abstract level, and accumulating
empirical evidence is not its intent (Jones et al., 1983, offer a detailed account of house-
hold response patterns based on unstructured home-interview survey results).
Useful in this context is the standard conceptualization of the driving task which
consists of: perception (visual or auditory reception of an external stimulus), identifica-
tion (understanding of the stimulus), emotion (decision of what action to take in response
to the stimulus) and reaction or volition (execution of the action). Each step involves 
time lag, which accumulates itself as the total response time. Some stimuli may not be
perceived at all, leading to nonresponse. The household’s response to changes in the travel
environment is quite analogous to this characterization of the driving task.
Information is not always acquired immediately, leading to imperfect information or
ignorance. This is one of the sources for response lags. A typical example is the time it
takes a solo driver to become aware of a new bus line which is suitable for his commute trip
and to which he may eventually switch. The process of experimentation and learning
results from conscientious effort to acquire information. Some learning almost necessarily
involves experimentation (trying out alternative commuting routes) while other may not
(checking car prices in the newspaper). Behavioral dynamics exhibited in the process 
learning can be found in Chang and Mahmassani (1988).
It is also probable that a change of small magnitude may not prompt any action. This
may be due to the presence of a threshold in perception (a "just noticeable difference";
Coombs, Dawes, and Tversky, 1970). However, small changes, each below the perception
threshold, may over time accumulate as a large change. Gradually intensifying highway
tThe discussion of this section draws in part on Goodwin, Kitamum and Meurs (1990). ¯ 404 R. KIrA~O~A
congestion is a good example. The notion of "cumulative effect)’ applies well in this
context; it may be hypothesized that the individual responds when the cumulative effect of
small changes exceeds a threshold. The threshold value itself may be a function of the
speed of accumulation; slow changes may allow the individual to get used to them (thereby
the threshold value is raised), while rapid accumulation may lead to more prompt reaction.
Or, it may be the case that "any reaction is delayed until the next ’life-shock’ (changing
jobs, life-cycle stage, home location, etc.)" (Clarke et al., 1982).
Constraints imposed on the household may lead to apparent response lags. For exam-
ple, the household may not immediately acquire an additional car after its member ac-
quires a driver’s license because it has not saved up a down-payment yet. This is a case of
resource constraint. _The cost of change is another source of response lags. For example,
residential relocation involves a considerable amount of monetary cost as well as the time
and effort required for searching. If the cost of change is larger than the benefit arising
from it, then rational behavior implies no change.
The discussion offers a way of viewing the "habitual" or "routine behavior," "be-
havioral inertia," or "resistance to change." Namely, the same behavior prevails even
after it is no longer optimum due to changes in the environment, because changing the
behavior involves monetary, time, and psychological costs. Delaying reaction until the
next life-shock may be a way of taking advantage of the economy of scale in behavioral
change.
This view is consistent with the notion of the speed of behavioral change or adjust-
ment. Jones et al. (1990) note that tightening constraints force quick reaction while
delayed response tends to follow loosening constraints. If the cost of behavioral change
implies resistance to change, then prompt change is not likely when constraints loosen,
thus forcing no change.
Also important is the notion of "leads" where an action precedes a change in the
environment. This may happen due to the decision maker’s planning effort in which an
action is taken in anticipation of a change. Like lags, leads would imply a mismatch
between the behavior and the environment (i.e. the behavior is not fully adjusted to (or has
changed ahead of) the environment). This is a case of "disequilibrium" (Goodwin et al.,
1987).
Implicit in our discussion has been the assumption that, given enough time, behavior
will eventually converge at an equilibrium (unless the magnitude of a change in the
environment is too small to react). The next question, then, is where this ultimate equilibri-
um is located. In particular, whether the point of equilibrium is influenced by the behav-
ioral path taken toward it. Related to this is the question of asymmetry in response
(Kitamura, 1989a; Kitamura and van der Hoorn, 1987) (i.e. the magnitude of change 
behavior may be different depending on the direction of the change).
Apparent behavioral asymmetry may be due to the differential speed of adjustment.
If a behavioral change in response to tightening constraints is more prompt than that
following loosening constraints, then the magnitude of change observed after a change in
constraints would exhibit asymmetry with the former showing a much larger change. If
this asymmetry is indeed due to the difference in the speed of adjustment, then asymmetry
should eventually disappear and responses in both directions would exhibit the same
magnitude of change.
If changes in travel behavior can be characterized as described so far, and if the speed
of adjustment is fast relative to the frequency of changes in the environment, then a
majority of the population is in behavioral equilibrium at any time point. Analysis on
cross-sectional data would approximate behavior-environment relationship at equilibrium,
and an estimated elasticity measure would represent long-term elasticity.
This may not be the ease if past experience permanently influences future behavior.
This would lead to truly asymmetric response in which the point of equilibrium depends
on the direction of change. For example, ultimate behavior would be different between a
household whose income has decreased by X from V + X to V and an otherwise identical
household whose income has increased by X from V - X to V. Generalizing this, the
location of behavioral equilibrium would depend on the entire past behavioral path, andPanel analysis in transportation planning 4O5
the behavioral path would exhibit hysteresis (Goodwin, 1977). This is a case of "state
dependence" where behavior is "irreversible."
This would also imply "multiple equilibria" (Mahmassani, 1990). If this indeed is the
case, then there is no unique behavior corresponding to a given set of conditions observed
in the environment. Behavioral relationship identified on cross-sectional observation
would not represent behavioral changes over time. This is the case where longitudinal data
and analysis are prerequisite for proper identification and prediction of behavior.
4. PANEL ANALYSIS METHODS
This section is a cursory review of analytical methods available for panel analysis of
travel behavior. The intent is to present selected classes of models in a unified framework.
The reader is referred to the cited references for more fundamental treatment of the
subject. In the discussion, we assume that we have panel observation taken at equi-spaced
time points. Therefore, the time can be represented by an integer index, and the notion of
the elapsed time between events is suppressed in the discussion (duration models therefore
lie outside the scope of the discussion here). This discretization of the time dimension is of
course an approximation which is subject to certain limitations, some of which are dis-
cussed later in Section 6. In addition, several classes of models in panel analysis are not
discussed as their applicability to travel demand analysis is not immediately clear. This
review is thus not intended to be exhaustive, but is an attempt to briefly summarize
discrete-time panel analysis methods that have been applied in dynamic travel behavior
analysis.
The objective of our analysis is to gain stochastic characterization of the observed
behavior at t, Y(t), as a function of the history of contributing factors, X(t) (X(t),
(X(t 1).... , X(0)), andpastbehavior, Y(t - (Y(t1).....Y(0))(i.e.to de-
termine the function P-) such that,
Pr[Y(t) <_ ylX(t), Y(t - 1)] F(y,X(t),Y(t- 1)
where bold-faced letters represent vectors. If Y is continuous, we have a class of regression
models:
Y(t) = G(X(t),Y(t- 1),~(t))
where ~(t) is a random error term from a distribution. Similarly, if Y is discrete,
Pr[Y(t)= j[X(t),Y(t 1)] = Hj(A~ ..... A~),j = 1 ..... J
Ak = Ak(X(t),Y(t 1),ek(0), k = 1,...
where J is the number of discrete states Y may assume, and Ak may be termed a "latent
variable." The well-known multinomial logit and probit models (for which J = K) fall 
this class of models.
The Markovian model represents a purely state dependent process,
Pr[Y(t) = j[X(t),Y(t- 1)] = Pr[Y(t) = j]Y(t- 1)] = Hj(Y(t- 
where X has no bearing on Y. As a special case, consider a Markov chain model of the
first order, i.e.,
Pr[Y(t) j]Y(t - 1)= Pr[Y(t) = JlY(t -1) =t]= p(i,j]
where p(i,j] is the "transition probability." This process can be studied by tabulating
observed transition frequencies as a two-way classification table where the (i,j) cell repre-
sents the observed frequency of transitions from i to j. Similarly, higher-order Markov
chain processes can be examined empirically using multi-way classification tables. Statisti-
cal tests for the assumptions of stationarity (that the transition probability is invariant
over time) and kth order history dependence (that Y(t) depends only on Y(t - 1) through
Y(t - k)) are discussed in Anderson and Goodman (1953). The log-linear model of classi-
fication table analysis can be conveniently utilized in hypothesis testing in this context.406 R. Krr~
Analysis using these Markovian models is critically limited because it offers no expla-
nation but replication. One would wish to explain the transition probability (or, the
probability of behavioral change) as a function of X(t) as well as the past history the
behavior itself, Y(t), This has led to the use of various discrete choice models as functional
specifications of the transition probabilities (e.g. Lerman, 1979; Kitamura and Kerman-
shah, 1983; van der Hoorn, 1983). In particular, choice models have been applied to
longitudinal analysis of household car ownership with a variety of assumptions about the
history dependence and inter-temporal correlation of the error terms (e.g. Hocherman et
al., 1983; Mannering and Winston, 1985; see Kitamura and Bunch, 1990, for a review).
The state-of-the-art of the estimation of discrete choice models with lag terms (Y(t)) 
inter-temporally correlated errors is not well advanced, limiting the types of dynamic
models (and model systems) that can be conveniently and appropriately estimated 
depict discrete choices observed over time.
The beta-logistic model (Heckman and Willis, 1977) is a notable exception in this
context which may be viewed as an approximate discrete choice model with individual-
specific error components. In its original form, however, the model is limited because of
the assumption that the series of choices made over time by each individual forms a
Bernoulli process consisting of repeated independent binary choices with identical choice
probabilities (its application to travel behavior can be found in Uncle, 1987). Extensions 
the original beta-logistic model can be found in Davies (1984) and Dunn and Wrigley
(1985), and an empirical application in Smith et al. (1986). The extensions, however, are 
the cost of losing the computational tractability that the original model offers. More
recently, Kitamura and Bunch (1990) have proposed ordered-response probit models with
individual specific random error components to examine the question of heterogeneity
(unobserved individual specific effects) versus state dependence (see Heckman, 1981b).
Their model formulation and estimation, while computationally tractable, is exact involv-
ing no approximation.
Extensive results are available on the formulation and estimation of dynamic models
that are linear in their parameters, i.e.
Y(t) = Q’Y(t - 1) + B’X(t) + 
where Q and B are coefficient vectors. A special case that deserves attention is
Y(t) = qY(t 1)+ B’X(t) + ~(t
where q and Y(t - 1) are scalar and X(t) contains measurements at t alone. The model
assumes that the observed behavior at time t is a function of the behavior observed at time
t - 1. This may be viewed as a model of "partial adjustment." Let the equilibrium
behavior, Y*, which would be reached when X remains unchanged at X(t), be given as 
= B’X(t). Assuming that behavioral adjustment is proportional to the difference between
the behavior in the previous period, Y(t - 1), and the equilibrium behavior, Y*, and with
the proportionality constant, (1 - q),
Y(t)= (1 - q)(Y* - Y(t 1)) + Y(t - 1)+ 6(t
= qY(t - 1) + (1 - q)B’X(t) + 
Another interpretation is possible by substituting the above expression into itself to obtain
the following geometric-lag model
Y(t)= B’X(t) qB’X(t - 1)+ q2B’X(t - 2) + ...
+ 6(t) + qe(t 1)+ q2~(t - 2) + ...
This is the most parsimonious version of the model which carries the effect of the entire
past history. This formulation is used in Meurs (1990) and Hensher and Smith (1990) 
the analysis of trip generation and vehicle utilization, respectively. Alternative estimation
procedures are also described in these papers, Griliches (1967) offers further discussions
on this class of models.Panel analysis in transportation planning 407
Alternative formulations of the error term have been proposed to capture the effects
of unobserved elements more appropriately. Because an error term represents the effects of
unobserved factors, some of which may remain unchanged over time, it is reasonable to
assume that errors are temporally correlated. This leads to the assumption of serial
correlation.
Alternative approach is the use of error components. For example, let
e(i,t) = u(O + v(t) + w(i,t)
where i refers to the individual observation, u(t) is a random error term representing the
effect that is specific to individual i and invariant over time, v(t) is a time-specific effect
that affect all individuals equally, and w(i,t) is a purely random error term. This error
formulation is used in the analysis of multi-day travel patterns by Pas and Koppelman
(1986). Both Hensher and Smith (1990) and Meurs (1990) adopt the random term, u(0, 
represent unobserved individual-specific random effect.
Another specification issue involved in the formulation of dynamic models concerns
the structure of lagged variables. Questions include: whether lagged X variables should be
included as well as, or in place of, lagged Y, and what the extent of the lag should be.
Although the identification of the structure of lags is said to be difficult (Griliches, 1967),
further investigation is due in this area to determine the characteristics of response lags in
travel behavior.
Structural equations models are a powerful tool in this context. The estimation princi-
ple adopted by this class of models is different; instead of maximizing the joint probability
that the measurements in the sample will occur, model parameters are determined so as to
best replicate the covariance matrix of the variables in the model system. This approach
facilitates the estimation of complex model systems with relative ease. Computer codes
have been developed to estimate such model systems and determine causal relationships
among a set of variables, which may include ordinal response variables as well as continu-
ous measurements.
A series of work by Golob and his colleagues (Golob, 1989, 1990; Golob and Meurs,
1987; Golob and van Wissen, 1988) offers an excellent overview of the available methods
and demonstrates their capabilities in dynamic travel behavior analysis. Quite important is
the ability these codes offer to estimate model systems simultaneously involving several
behavioral measures of interest (e.g. car ownership, trip generation, and travel expendi-
ture). A similar, perhaps less versatile, approach is the log-linear model of cross-classifica-
tion tables. Examples include Kitamura (1989b) and Supernak and Kitamura (1989). 
the structural equations approach, the log-linear model, and the traditional econometric
approach compare with each other, and whether they arrive at comparable model specifi-
cations and behavioral interpretations, remain as a challenging research subject.
Several unresolved issues exist in the estimation of dynamic models using panel data.
These center around the estimation of dynamic discrete choice models:
1.Representation of the initial condition: No information is usually available from a panel
data set on variable values prior to the survey. Several approaches have been proposed to
represent initial conditions for the linear model; the method in Hensher and Smith
(1990) is to express the initial conditions using observed variables (Bhargava 
Sargan, 1983), while Meurs (1990) uses instrument variables. Methods are not well
established for nonlinear models including the discrete choice model; see Heckman
(1981a).
2.Estimation of multi-period, multi-alternative discrete choice models: Although it is
evident that multi-period, multi-alternative discrete choice can be represented by a
multinomial probit model (Daganzo and Sheffi, 1982), application of the multinomial
probit model is limited due to the computational difficulty it poses and the model
identification issues involved (Dansie, 1985; Bunch and Kitamura, 1990). The only
published empirical example of probit panel analysis that the author is aware of in-408 R. K1x~o_rgA
volves only two alternatives at two time points (Johnson and Hensher, 1982). 
alternative is a single-equation approach where a model is estimated for each period
separately with correction terms to account for longitudinal correlation in the error
term (Kitamura, 1987). The statistical efficiency of this approach, however, needs to 
determined. The recent developments in beta-logistic models and error-component or-
dered-response probit models discussed above indicate that certain types of multi-
period, multi-alternative discrete choice models can be practically estimated.
3.Correlated errors in a dynamic model system: Again, estimation theory is well advanced
for the system of linear dynamic models. It is frequent in transportation planning that a
model system must involve both discrete and continuous dependent variables, requiring
nonlinear models as components. Car type choice and utilization (Hensher, 1986;
Mannering and Winston, 1985) and car ownership and trip generation (Golob, 1990;
Kitamura, 1988b) are good examples. These studies use varying degrees of assumptions
about the longitudinal correlation of the error terms involved, with some completely
ignoring the possibility of correlation. A few studies that account for such correlation
use correction terms to account for possible biases due to correlated errors. The same
comments raised above for the case of discrete-time panel analysis apply here. As noted
earlier, comparative analysis of the conventional maximum likelihood estimation and
the structured equations approach is another subject for future investigation.
4.Model identifiability and data requirements: An empirical question is the estimability
of a given model when the explanatory variables are "slow moving," or behavioral
changes of interest are infrequent. In the extreme case where the explanatory variables
do not change at all, then the information content in the data is similar to that in the
analysis of variance with repeated measurements. The data would not support the
analysis of behavioral dynamics except for the variation in behavior across observa-
tional occasions. The issue is more complex when the dependent variable is discrete,
and requires further investigation.
5. DEMAND FORECASTING WITH DYNAMIC MODELS
The application of cross-sectional models to forecasting necessarily involves the as-
sumption that the model coefficients obtained based on cross-sectional variation in behav-
ior can be used to predict behavioral changes over time. The use of dynamic models in
forecasting, on the other hand, is an attempt to extrapolate longitudinal trends in the data
into the future.
The procedure of forecasting is fundamentally different between cross-sectional and
dynamic models. In the case of cross-sectional models, the values of the explanatory
variables, X, for the horizon year, T, are (usually externally) forecast, then a forecast,
Y(T), is obtained simply by plugging in X(T) into the model equation. For a linear model,
this is
where Ii is a coefficient vector estimated on a cross-sectional data observed at, say, t. For
the linear model, the procedure applies to disaggregate households or individuals in the
study area, or to aggregate averages.
Application of a dynamic model to forecasting is fundamentally different. For one
thing, the coefficients of a dynamic model reflect the observational time span in the
longitudinal data used for estimation. Forecasting, therefore, must be performed using the
same time span; if the panel data used for model estimation were collected with one-year
intervals, then one-year intervals must also be used for prediction.
Forecasting with a dynamic model is not a single shot into a distant future. It consists
of a series of forecasts obtained using appropriate time intervals. For a linear model,
noting that a sum of errors has an expectation of O, and assuming that the standard error
of q is negligibly small,Panel analysis in transportation planning
1?(t + 1) = #Y(t) A’X(t + 1)
1?(t + 2) = #1?(t + 1) A’X(t + 2)4o9
I?(7) = #1?(T- 1) + A’X(T)
where ~ and .~ are obtained using panel data, and the X’s are forecast (externally) for all
the interim time points. (This procedure can be used with aggregate averages of X and Y if
the model is linear. For discrete-choice models which are difficult to aggregate, the proce-
dure applies only at the disaggregate level. This is discussed later.) Other possible use of
dynamic data and models for forecasting can be found in van der Hoorn and Kitamura
(1987) and Wolfe (1989).
As is evident in the above discussion, dynamic forecasting requires more input (al-
though this may not impose any burden because many input variables such as demograph-
ic variables, are forecast by extrapolating observed trends using small time increments).
This added cost, however, produces the following advantages:
1.Changes in demand that may take place over time after a change in the environment can
be forecast.
2.A planning scenario can be represented as a sequence of events, allowing more versatile
and strategic evaluation of alternative planning options.
3.Dynamic forecasting is not longitudinal extrapolation of cross-sectional variations.
The advantage extends beyond these when future behavior is microscopically simulated
using dynamic models and panel observation.
Given a system of dynamic models formulated at the household or individual level,
evolution of households and changes in their behavior can be simulated through stochastic
simulation. Such simulation is most meaningful when models are available to simulate all
salient household and personable attributes, such as car ownership, employment, and
driver’s license holdings. When a simulation model system represents the evolution of the
household in its demographic, socioeconomic, and mobility characteristics, it may be
called a "microanalytic simulation."
There are several reasons to believe that this approach to demand forecasting is
worthy to pursue. The most important are:
1.Endogenous generation of explanatory variables: Many advances have been made in the
formulation and estimation of disaggregate travel demand models in the past 15 years
or so. However, forecasts of the explanatory variables used in these models are typically
unavailable at a comparable disaggregate level. Using microanalytic simulation, these
explanatory variables can be internally determined instead of being imported from
external forecasting sources, thus fully support disaggregate behavioral models.
2.Cohesive forecasts of interactive variables: Many household and personable attributes
are interrelated. Accordingly, a household’s "long-term response may, in fact, be much
more complex involving changes of home and job location, car ownership changes, and
so on" (Mackett, 1990). In microanalytic simulation, these variables are forecast in 
cohesive manner using model components replicating decisions by the household and
individual.
These advantages, in turn, would lead to
3.More realistic and consistent forecasting: Microanaiytic simulation is capable of cap-
turing the repercussions of a change by simulating a chain of changes that follows the410
initial change, thus representing complex cause-effect relationships, and capturing full
consequences of a change in the environment.
Use of simulation to generate explanatory variables for demand forecasting with
disaggregate models is not new. Examples can be found in a corridor planning model
developed for the San Francisco Bay Area (Talvitie et al., 1976) and a nationwide demand
forecasting models system based on synthetic sample households (Daly and Gunn, 1986).
But dynamic simulation, while often used in demography, is a concept new in travel
demand forecasting. Examples include Goodwin et al. (1987), Kitamura and Goulias
(1988), Mackett (1990), and Miller et al. (1987). The system by Mackett (1988) is developed
based largely on cross-sectional data, while Kitamura and Goulias construct their dynamic
model components using a panel data set. The simulation system by Miller et al. (1987),
developed for the analysis of housing demand, and that by Kitamura and Goulias (1988)
both have detailed demographic and employment components. The latter includes models
of household car ownership and trip generation by mode. These two models are, however,
still in their developmental stages; microanalytic simulation is a new concept in the field of
transportation planning whose feasibility and value need to be further examined.
6. PANEL SURVEY
The models and forecasting procedures discussed above require longitudinal data
obtained through a panel survey. The discussion of this section is concerned with the
advantages and disadvantages of panel surveys.t
From a statistical viewpoint, a panel survey has the definite advantage that it offers
more accurate estimates of changes than would repeated cross-sectional surveys of the
same sample size (Cochran, 1977). For example, suppose one wishes to monitor changes 
bus use that may follow an introduction of a new line, and a sample of 1,000 households is
drawn for a surx;ey prior to the introduction of the line. If estimating change is the primary
concern, then it is best to survey the same 1,000 households again after the new line opens.
This increased accuracy offered by the panel survey implies that its sample size is smaller
than the one required for a cross-sectional survey to attain the same level of accuracy in the
estimates of changes. It is also important to note that sampling cost may be substantially
reduced in a panel survey when the same set of respondents is repeatedly interviewed.
There are many additional advantages of panel surveys, some of which have been
discussed in Section 2. A panel survey allows the analyst to observe changes in contribut-
ing factors and changes in travel behavior, which, in turn, allows more precise determina-
tion of causal relationships and model development. A panel survey also facilitates the
observation of changes over time in travel behavior. For example, it will facilitate the
examination of how new suburban residents adapt to the new travel environment and form
their travel patterns. Such an analysis will shed light on the issue of suburban congestion
and the question of improving transit services in the suburb. Panel analysis will be an
indispensable tool in many planning and policy contexts as urban areas continue to unfold
with changing demographic, socioeconomic, land use, level-of-service, and travel behavior
characteristics.
These advantages of panel analysis, however, are accompanied by certain difficulties.
Extreme care must be exercised in order to obtain survey responses that support the
intended analysis. Consideration must be given to:
1. possible increase in nonresponses due to the fact that respondents are required to
participate in more than one survey,
2. problem of attrition (i.e. dropping out of respondents between waves of surveys)
3. problem of locating respondents in multiple survey waves due to residential relocation
and dissolution of households,
4. possible decline in reporting accuracy due to "panel fatigue," and
?Kasprzyk et al. (1989) offer an excellent treatment of this subject.Panel analysis in transportation planning 411
5. problem of "panel conditioning" where the behavior and responses in later surveys are
influenced by the fact of participating in the panel, and also by the responses to earlier
surveys.
Additional effort is due in panel surveys to maintain desired sample properties (e.g.
population representativeness):
6. increased sampling effort due to the need to introduce new respondents to augment
drop-out panel households and "refresh" the panel,
7. need to represent changing populations by sampling new households, and
8. need to sample in-migrating and other new households in the study area.
And the fact that
9. data collection effort inevitably takes longer,
may preclude the use of panel analysis in some instances.
Examples of these problems can be found in the Dutch National Mobility Panel
survey (Golob et al., 1986; van Wissen and Meurs, 1989). It is a general purpose transpor-
tation survey whose instruments included a weekly trip diary. In an initial screening survey
conducted to establish the panel, addresses in 20 municipalities were randomly sampled
and 6,128 households were contacted by phone, or at home if no telephone number was
available (Golob et al., 1986). Of these, only 2,886 households (47.1%) indicated that they
were willing to participate in the panel survey. Out of the 2,886 households, a stratified
random sample of 2,185 households was selected as the initial panel and home interviews
were administered. Usable responses were obtained only from 1,764 households (80.7%)
of the households interviewed.
Attrition was also substantial in the Dutch panel survey, especially between the first
wave and the second wave which was conducted six months later. Of the 1,764 households
in the first wave, only 1,196 (67.8%) responded to the second-wave survey. This high
attrition rate is perhaps due in part to a change in survey administration; those households
that were in the first wave were contacted only by mail (Kitamura and Bovy, 1985).
Attrition in the Dutch panel survey was clearly selective, with low-income house-
holds, smaller households, households without cars, and those with lower education
dropping out at higher rates (Golob et al., 1986; Kitamura and Bovy, 1985, 1987). Of the
1,764 households that were in the first wave, 1031 (58.4%), 853 (48.4%), 668 (37.9%), 
629 (35.7%) remained in the panel in waves 3, 5, 7, and 9, respectively (spaced with one-
year intervals; van Wissen and Meurs, 1989).
The issue of reporting accuracy in the Dutch panel survey is addressed in Meurs et al.
(1989). As in Golob and Meurs (1986), they found trip reporting decline gradually within
each diary period.t Using the average number of trips reported on the first diary day as a
reference, Meurs et al., estimate that trip under-reporting amounted to an average of 2.27
trips per week per person in the first survey that a respondent participated. This increased
to 4.44 trips in a second survey, and up to 8.35 trips by the time a respondent stayed in the
panel to participate in a seventh survey (Meurs et al., 1989).
Careful and well planned survey design and administration will help minimize nonre-
sponse, attrition, and response errors. Some of the problems cited above can be resolved
during the tabulation and analysis of survey results. Hensher (1987) lists as factors influ-
encing panel participation: (i) duration of the interview, (ii) interviewer, (iii) household 
individual (contact respondent) characteristics, and (iv) household and individual mobili-
ty. The results of Kitamura and Bovy (1987) offer evidence on the last two factors.
Nonresponse and attrition caused by these factors tend to be selective (as opposed to
tBailar (1989) reports similar declining tendencies in reporting in a consumer expenditure diary survey.
TR(A) :’4:6.Brandom) as shown above. This will lead to biased estimates of means and proportions.
Although the selection on exogenous variables by itself does not bias regression and other
model estimation results, likely selection on unobserved elements may. It is desirable that
these problems be resolved by recontacting and (in case of attrition) tracing nonrespon-
dents, When this is not done or not complete, the sample should be weighted to account
for nonresponse or attrition biases. Such weights may be developed using auxiliary varia-
bles that well predict "target statistics," or behavioral measures of concern, as well as the
response rate (van de Pol, 1987). In the case of attrition, a probabilistic model of attrition,
constructed using measurement from the earlier survey wave(s), can be used to formulate 
more efficient weight that takes advantage of mobility and other available information
(Kitamura and Bovy, 1987). For discussions on panel conditioning and reporting accuracy,
see Golob (1990), Golob and Meurs (1986), Meurs et al. (1989), and van de Pol (1987).
Sample size requirements for a panel survey can be derived from the available sam-
pling theory. Attention should be paid to the fact that the analyst is often interested in
measuring differences or estimating the probability of changes. Another dimension in
sample design, then, is the rate of behavioral change in respective population subgroups.
Stratified sampling schemes may be developed to account for the rate of change in the
target measure as well as its mean and standard deviation within each population stratum,
Important in this context is the finding that households in earlier stages of life-cycle tend
to undergo many life-shocks and changes (Clarke et al. 1982; Goodwin, 1987).
The duration of a survey and the frequency of interviews are additional elements of
panel survey design. The duration of a survey is determined by the characteristics of the
behavioral aspect under investigation. For example, 2 years may be long enough to study
ride-share behavior among households with cars, while 5 to 10 years may be needed for
residential location. Note that varia~ilky in both behavioral measures and explanatory
variables needs to be considered in selecting the duration of a panel survey. Consideration
should also be given to panel conditioning, attrition, initial participation rate, and the
practicality of following the respondents over a long span of time.
The variability in the behavior and the contributing factors is a principal factor that
determines the frequency of interviews. Frequent interviews would produce data contain-
ing fewer changes in each wave, while some changes would be overlooked (Bailar, 1989).
The need to maintain a desirable panel leads to additional considerations. Frequent inter-
views would reduce the chance of loosing respondents due to relocation and lead to more
accurate responses if retrospective questions are involved. At the same time, they may lead
to increased nonresponse and attrition as they require an increased level of commitment on
the part of the panel members, and the results may be more susceptible to panel
conditioning.
Panel analysis is a new approach in transportation planning. This paper has shown
that panel analysis offers many advantages over the conventional cross-sectional ap-
proaches. It has also identified many difficulties and issues that are yet to be resolved. It is
believed that further investigation in the near future will offer solutions to many of the
problems, and the panel analysis will become a standard tool for travel behavior analysis
and demand forecasting.
